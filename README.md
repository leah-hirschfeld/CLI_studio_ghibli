Hello!

Welcome to the first project for Flatiron's Software Engineering bootcamp!

This will be a CLI (Command Line Interface) that utilizes the Studio Ghibli
API (Application Programming Interface). The program will be able to get
a user's input and provide that user with information on a Studio Ghibli film
or director.

Thank you for taking the time to check out this project!
